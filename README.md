# Hi, I'm Swaleh Zaidi!

## 🎓 **Education**  
- Electrical Engineering student at the University of Calgary
- Entering 3rd year and just finished work this spring and summer as a **Software Engineering Research Intern**, funded by NSERC's USRA

## My Interests

### 🛠️ Hardware & Electronics  
- Very interested in **RF systems**, **analog design**, and **embedded hardware**
- Familiar with STM32, Jetson Nano, and KiCad through clubs and research
- Enjoy working at the intersection of hardware and software. Currently learning more about signal routing, power delivery, and hardware debugging

### 💻 Embedded AI & Software  
- Passionate about **low-level embedded programming**. Currently learning about this through hands-on club work, using STM32 **HAL** and **PAC** libraries in Rust to interact with peripherals and develop embedded applications
- Comfortable working in Linux environments; using debuggers and serial communication tools to troubleshoot embedded systems.  
- Fascinated by the applications of AI. This interest led to pursuing research in the field of AI through the DENOS Lab at the University of Calgary. Here, I am building a multi-model pipeline using Python sockets, FAISS, and RAG — optimizing for real-time inference in healthcare applications.
